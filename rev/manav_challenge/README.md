## Description
For years, Cyber-Solutions was the gold standard in digital security, the guardian of businesses worldwide. But that was before Krypto arrived. The newcomer didn’t just compete—it dominated, leaving Cyber-Solutions in the dust. Their stock plummeted nearly 50%, their reputation shattered.

And now, scandal.

The CEO of Cyber-Solutions stands accused of something far worse than corporate failure—whispers of shady dealings, hidden transactions, and secrets buried deep in encrypted files. Then came the leak. Data from the CEO’s personal computer, exposed for the world to see.

But is he truly guilty? Or has someone engineered the perfect takedown?

The truth is locked away in the binary. Decode it, and uncover whether the CEO is the mastermind of his own downfall—or the victim of something far more sinister.
