## Backstory

Upon inspecting DNS traffic logs, it was found that secard.ca appeared as an anomaly in the logs. The NYPD seized the website but couldnt find anything. Maybe there is somehting they are missing?
## Intended Solve

*To solve, just lookup secard.ca TXT records haha.*

## Handouts

- https://secard.ca/

## TODO
Please change challenge name.
Change the flag from temporary to real flag.
