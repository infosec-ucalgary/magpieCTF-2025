# All Ends Same

## Description
Despite our differences, Professor Richard Hash and I are working towards the same core goal: secure communication. The irony is that, in the end, cryptography—whether through his traditional methods or my evolving approaches—always comes down to the same fundamental “format”: transforming data into something unrecognizable to anyone who doesn’t have the key to decrypt it. Whether you use numbers, text, or any other form, cryptography boils down to one principle: securing information by making it unreadable without proper authorization. The formats may change, but the underlying idea remains the same—data must be protected from unauthorized access. It’s this constant need for security that binds our work, even when our methods diverge.
