## Description
Richard and I had been at odds because he believed that the traditional methods of cryptography—rigid, unchanging, and focused solely on security—were the only way forward. I, on the other hand, had been pushing for more adaptive, flexible systems that could respond to the evolving digital landscape. But homomorphism—the idea that one structure can transform into another without losing its underlying properties—finally gave me a way to merge both our approaches. This solution didn’t just satisfy the need for security—it allowed me to prove that both of our ideas could coexist, evolving together rather than one overpowering the other. In the end, the conflict that had strained our relationship was dissolved—not by compromise, but by a deeper understanding that both sides could evolve together. We respect each other as always.

## Hints

## Solution
This is a homomorphic attack on RSA, which can be prevented using RSA-OAEP.
See solve.py for detailed solution.
