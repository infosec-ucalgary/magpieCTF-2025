# CatPic-Easy-Forensics

**Concept**: To complete this challenge, the users need to simply cat the file. They will be greeted with an embedded script which changes the desktop background to a new image. The users need to find this new image and get the flag which is inside of it's metadata

**TODO:** Jake pls give me AWS access, I need to host the images!!! Have Jason make new images for the challenge. Jason if you are reading this, pls make a cover image and a chatlog image (once we have a narative suspect assigned to this challenge).
