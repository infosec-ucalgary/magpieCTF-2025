            <h3>Your First Mission Briefing</h3>
            <h5>Case Title: The Neon Phantom</h5>
            <p> A series of high-profile thefts have rocked the neon-lit streets of Lower Manhattan. The perpetrator,
                known only as The Neon Phantom, has been targeting high-tech cybernetic enhancements from wealthy elites
                and corporate executives. The Phantom leaves behind a trail of flickering neon graffiti and encrypted
                holographic messages, taunting the NYPD at every turn.
                Your mission is to track down the Phantom, recover the stolen tech, and bring them to justice. Be
                warned: this is no ordinary criminal. The Phantom is rumored to have access to advanced cyberware and a
                network of underground informants.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                The Phantom has been spotted frequenting The Neon Lantern, a speakeasy hidden beneath the streets of
                Chinatown. The establishment is known for its clientele of hackers, smugglers, and rogue engineers.
                Proceed with cautionâ€”the Lantern is a hotbed of illegal activity, and the Phantom has allies in the
                shadows.
