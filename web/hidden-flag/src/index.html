    <p>Journal Entry: "March 15, 1933"</p>
    <p>"Today marks a monumental achievement in the world of communication. My encryption device is ready for the
      world's stage. This invention will ensure that secrets, once bound by the limitations of paper and ink, are now
      encrypted and protected at the highest level. It will change everything."</p>
    <p>"For too long, people have lived in the illusion of privacy. In reality, anyone with the right skills could
      intercept and expose private messages. With this technology, those days will be over. No longer will
      communications be vulnerable to prying eyes. What was once freely shared will now be securely locked away."</p>
    <p>"This is more than just technology; it's a revolution in how we protect our most personal information. I know
      there will be those who resist it, those who profit from exploiting weak systems, but this device will eliminate
      the so-called 'freedom' theyâ€™ve enjoyed. The power to control information will no longer lie in the hands of the
      few who exploit vulnerabilities. Instead, it will be in the hands of those who understand the importance of true,
      impenetrable privacy."</p>
    <p>"The world will thank me for it, eventually. The message must be clear: the future is secure, and it belongs to
      those who innovate, not to those who tear down systems from the shadows."</p>
