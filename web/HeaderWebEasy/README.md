## Backstory
Suspect Explo apparently has a secret website hosted at [website here], but it doesnt look like thereâ€™s anything wrong with it upon first glance. Once an HTTP head request is sent, the website changes to a hitpiece rant about how Explo hates christina and how christina betrayed him.

## Intended Solve
To complete this challenge, the users need to simply send an HTTP HEAD request to the server. This can be done using tools like Insomnia or Postman.  

## Handouts
- [Website Address Here]

## TODO:
Make the website actually fit the theme.
