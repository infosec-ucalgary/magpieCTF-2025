        A note from Jake:
        <br>
        The NYPD was always too slow for me. Christina may be brilliant but she could never hire anyone as smart as her. All the bureacracy bogging down your systems would be the exact reason you fell.
        This hack wasn’t just a rivalry—it was personal.
        Christina thought she was untouchable. Thought she could outplay me. But in the end, even Krypto couldn't secure her systems from me.
