# PWN Challenges

`nsjail` is built overtop `debian:bookworm-slim`, here's the [link](https://packages.debian.org/bookworm/libc-bin) for its `libc`.

The challenge series `printf` are (obviously) challenges whose main exploit uses `printf`.

The challenge series `stack` are ret2win challenges i.e., the hacker is supposed to use some form of exploit
to redirect execution to some `win` function.
