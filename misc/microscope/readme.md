Flag: `magpieCTF{bEtweenthELIneS}`

## Backstory

Just look REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEAAAAAALLY hard

## Intended Solve

Separate the subpixels of the image into RGB in a photo editor to reveal the flag, or if possible, 
use your phone or some secondary device to take a zoomed in photo of the image on your monitor at 
normal resolution (i.e. zoom in the camera on the secondary device).
